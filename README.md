# Task Scheduler
I have designed and developed a Task Scheduler Chrome extension using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The extension provides users with a convenient and efficient way to schedule and manage their tasks directly from their Chrome browser.

With this extension, users can easily create, organize, and prioritize their tasks, ensuring that they stay on top of their commitments and enhance their productivity. The user-friendly interface allows for seamless task entry, and tasks can be categorized, labeled, and assigned due dates.

Key Features:

Task Creation: Users can quickly add new tasks using the intuitive interface of the extension. They can enter task descriptions, set due dates, and assign labels or categories for better organization.
Task Organization: The extension provides options for categorizing tasks, allowing users to group them based on projects, priorities, or any custom categories they define. This enables efficient management and easy filtering of tasks.
Reminder Notifications: Users receive timely reminders for upcoming tasks, ensuring they stay aware of important deadlines and commitments. These notifications help in maintaining focus and meeting task deadlines.
Task Tracking: The extension enables users to mark tasks as complete, providing a sense of accomplishment as they progress through their to-do lists. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from pending ones for quick reference.
Persistence: The extension utilizes local storage to save tasks, ensuring that user data is securely stored and can be accessed even after closing the browser. This allows for seamless task management across different sessions.
By developing this Task Scheduler Chrome extension, I have demonstrated my proficiency in web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as my ability to create user-friendly interfaces and enhance productivity through effective task management. The project showcases my skills in front-end development, problem-solving, and attention to detail.

Overall, this project highlights my commitment to developing practical solutions that optimize workflows and assist individuals in effectively managing their tasks and responsibilities.
